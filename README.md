simple Shadowrun figures to visualize battle scenarios
=====

To help the gamemaster I decided to use my 3d printer finaly for something useful

simple but effective models to visalize the battlefield the gamemaster tries to explain during a Shadowrun fight  
No more discussion whether there is a wall there or a sight of line or cover or where the runner in fact is standing  
Since the rooms/areas may differ I sticked to simple objects for the begining so you could build everyhing you wanted  

I'll add some more complex figures as I'll play and see what is missing

All figures have a width of 30mm or a multiple

also a single hole for a magnet, since ABS/PLA doesn't have that much weight I used [this](https://www.magnet-shop.net/neodym-magnete/scheibenmagnete/scheibenmagnet-30-x-20-mm-n35-nickel-haelt-300-g::1310.html) ( german supplier) wich has a diameter of 3mm and a heigh of 2m,m holds about 300grams

Since the hole is greater than the magnet you'll need something to glue it in there

two-component glue worked great for me so far, hot glue couldn't hold the magnet in place when put on steel and sticked to it then instead of the object

I used two short steel-wire pices to fixate the magnet on top, otherwise it'll be not strong enough to hold it in place  
a pic tells just more :)

I'll make some pictures the next time we play to show you

Here is my current collection

Current models in this repository
(stl as well as sketchup14 files)

The numbered markers are available as well with as without magnet holes(flatter) not sure which is better yet
For some reason slic3r is unable to slice a "4" and a "5" properly, curaEngine works fine with me though

For some difference i found ![these](www.thingiverse.com/thing:400453) at thingiverse, I like them :)

walls:
----

 - half cover (20mm high) 
 - full cover (30mm high)
 - outer wall of a building (40mm high)
 - outer wall of a building with a window (40mm high)

interior:
----
 - table (20mm high)

misc:
----
 - oil barrel (30mm high)
 - numbered markers (d 20mm)

have fun and enjoy :)
